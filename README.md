# Marginal Distribution Plot using Stata (Scatter + Box) - V1

A combined marginal distribution plot created in Stata. 

Here we are plotting scatter and box plots to view distribution in detail. The plot for now is at an initial stage and requires tweaking.

Currently I am using -graph combine- to create such a plot (which is something inefficient in my view).

Next iteration will look at making use of -twoway- only to create such plots by group.

The scheme used is by Asjad Naqvi and is called gg_tableau from his package 'schemepack'
